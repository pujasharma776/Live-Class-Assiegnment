    "Entities in the ERD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User:**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Order:**\n",
    "   - Attributes: OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, Status, etc.\n",
    "   - Relationships: Orders are placed by Users and contain Products.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Payment:**\n",
    "   - Attributes: PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentDate, PaymentMethod, Amount, etc.\n",
